            <h2>For centuries, composers have used their own names or secret messages as a basis for composition.<br>This is known as <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_cryptogram" target="_blank">musical cryptography</a>.</h2>
            <p id = "info">In the most common form of musical cryptogram, the letters in a word or message are represented by their corresponding note names. However, because there are 26 letters in the alphabet and only 7 named notes, from the letter 'H', we begin again with the note 'A'. For example, the word 'beach' would be represented by the notes 'B', 'E', 'A', 'C' and the final letter 'H' would become 'A'.</p>
